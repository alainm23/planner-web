I"Î<p>Over the the past few months we‚Äôve been working on Planner 2.4, a big update with great new features. Priorities, calendar events, Quick Add for all platforms and more.

<h2 id="-priority-support"><i class="far fa-flag"></i> Priority support</h2>
<p>Not all tasks are created equal. Use priority levels to make sure the most important things on your list stand out.</p>

<p>You can give your tasks one of four priority levels ‚Äì 1 being the most important (marked as red) and 4 being everything else (no color).</p>

<ul>
  <li>To add a task priority even faster, you can type <strong>p1</strong>, <strong>p2</strong>, or <strong>p3</strong> right into the task field. Planner will automatically recognize and assign the right priority level when you create the task.</li>
  <li>Filter all your tasks with priorities from <strong>Quick Find</strong>.</li>
  <li>The priorities are synchronized with <strong>Todoist</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-project-deadline"><i class="fas fa-hourglass-start"></i> Project Deadline</h2>
<p>When you have been given a date by which you need to complete a project or face consequences, add <strong>Deadline</strong>.
Here‚Äôs how to add a Deadline to your projects:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select <b>Edit</b> by right-clicking on your project in the left pane.</li>
<li>Enable <b>Deadline</b> and select a date.</li>
<li>A progress indicator and the selected date are added in the project view.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="-links-everywhere"><i class="fa fa-link"></i> Links Everywhere</h2>
<p>The app now handles links consistently in all places: inside the title, inside notes, and inside checklist items.</p>

<h2 id="-quick-find-improvements"><i class="fa fa-search"></i> Quick Find Improvements</h2>
<p>You want to filter your tasks by priorities or by labels more quickly, <strong>Open Quick Find</strong> and select a filter, the labels and priorities are default every time you start Quick Find. The design and performance were also improved by making the searches faster.

<h2 id="-quick-add-improvements"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> Quick Add Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Quick Add</strong> came to Plane a long time ago but unfortunately it only works on elementary OS. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nils-asmussen">Nils Asmussen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bilelmoussaoui">Bilal Elmoussaoui</a> it works in Flatpak.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i style="color: #f9c440;" class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> To make this possible we had to make some changes in flatpak and it‚Äôs possible that the synchronization with Todoist doesn‚Äôt work, to solve this you can re-login to your Todoist account from the preferences.</li>
  <li>To add a task priority, you can type <strong>p1</strong>, <strong>p2</strong>, or <strong>p3</strong> right into the task field.</li>
  <li>To add a date, you can type <strong>today</strong> or <strong>tomorrow</strong> right into the task field.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-keyboard-shortcuts-improvements"><i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i> Keyboard Shortcuts Improvements</h2>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are now better in Planner. A new dialog has been added to see the full list of keyboard shortcuts and many keyboard shortcuts have been added and modified.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <span class="keyboardkey">f1</span>  to open keyboard shortcuts dialog.</li>
  <li>Use <span class="keyboardkey">a</span> and <span class="keyboardkey">q</span> to create a new task.</li>
  <li>Use <span class="keyboardkey">p</span>, <span class="keyboardkey">f</span> and <span class="keyboardkey">s</span> to create a new project, folder or section.</li>
  <li>Use <span class="keyboardkey">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyboardkey">v</span> to create a task from the clipboard.

</ul>

<h2 id="-today--upcoming-improvements"><i class="far fa-star"></i> Today &amp; Upcoming Improvements</h2>
<p>Now you can sort your tasks by drag and drop and the option to reschedule your overdue tasks was added.

<h2 id="-calendar-events"><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i> Calendar events</h2>
<p>Calendar events is one of the most amazing features Planner has. Unfortunately not everyone could use this feature. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tintou">Corentin No√´l</a> Planner now supports the latest version of <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/stable/tech-eds.html">EDS</a> and calendar events are displayed correctly.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-more-things">A few more things‚Ä¶</h2>

  <li>Improved the synchronization system with Todoist.</li>
  <li>Now you can add a project directly in a work area.</li>

  <li>Visual enhancements for tasks that have already expired.</li>
</ul>
