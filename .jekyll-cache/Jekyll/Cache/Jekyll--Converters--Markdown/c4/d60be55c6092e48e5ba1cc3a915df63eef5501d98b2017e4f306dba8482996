<h3 id="quick-find">Quick Find</h3>
<p>Quick Find arrives with a big redesign and a ton of new features to make integration with Planner better. First, the design is based on <a href="https://github.com/tom95/indicator-synapse">Synapse Indicator</a> thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tom95">Tom Beckmann</a>, this new design allows us to better order the elements to be displayed.
Now you can do searches for <strong>Tasks</strong>, <strong>Projects</strong>, <strong>Views</strong> and <strong>Labels</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Searches are more accurate and are highlighted if there are matches.</li>
  <li>You can navigate faster between Inbox, Today and Upcoming views.</li>
  <li>Search by labels and filter all your tasks.

</ul>

<h3 id="recurring-tasks">Recurring Tasks</h3>
<p>Recurring tasks finally arrive at Planner 2.3, with support for Todoist and an easy way to use it,
but if you do not know that it is a recurring task we explain:</p>

<p>You likely have tasks that repeat themselves on a regular basis ‚Äì monthly reports, putting out the garbage, remembering to call Mom on her birthday.
Instead of creating a new task for each occurrence, give it a recurring due date. When you complete a recurring task, it will automatically reset for the next due date with no extra effort required on your part.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repeat your tasks <strong>every day</strong>, <strong>week</strong>, <strong>month</strong> or <strong>year</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you complete a recurring task a <strong>Quick Notification</strong> will be sent showing you the new scheduled date.</li>
  <li>Recurring tasks sync with <strong>Todoist</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-few-more-things">A few more things‚Ä¶</h3>
