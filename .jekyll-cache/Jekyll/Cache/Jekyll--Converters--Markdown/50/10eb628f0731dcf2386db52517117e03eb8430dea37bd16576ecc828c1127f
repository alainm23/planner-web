<h2 id="sub-project">Sub-project</h2>
<p>One of the most requested features comes to Planner 2.6, keep your ever-growing project list neat and organized with sub-projects.</p>

<p>You can collapse sub-projects under their ‚Äúparent‚Äù projects to temporarily hide them from view. This helps to focus on the right projects at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.</p>
