    <em>Planner - Quick Find Redesign</em>
</p>
<h3 id="quick-find">Quick Find</h3>
<p>Quick Find arrives with a big redesign and a ton of new features to make integration with Planner better. First, the design is based on <a href="https://github.com/tom95/indicator-synapse">Synapse Indicator</a> thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tom95">Tom Beckmann</a>, this new design allows us to better order the elements to be displayed.
Now you can do searches for <strong>Tasks</strong>, projects, views and labels.
