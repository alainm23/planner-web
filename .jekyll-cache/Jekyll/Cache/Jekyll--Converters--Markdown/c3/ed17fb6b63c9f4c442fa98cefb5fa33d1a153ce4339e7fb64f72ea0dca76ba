I"‡<p>A new update comes to Planner. Planner is a task manager with good design and synchronization with Todoist.</p>

<h3 id="quick-add">Quick Add</h3>

<p>Don‚Äôt worry about which app you‚Äôre using. You can use a keyboard shortcut to open the <strong>Quick Add</strong> window, where you can enter a pending task and quickly return to work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The default keyboard shortcut is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + Tab</code> but you can change it from preferences.</li>
</ul>
