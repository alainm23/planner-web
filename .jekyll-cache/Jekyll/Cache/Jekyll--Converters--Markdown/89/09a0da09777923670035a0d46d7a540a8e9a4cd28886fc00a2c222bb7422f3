<h2 id="sub-project">Sub-project</h2>
<p>One of the most requested features comes to Planner 2.6, keep your ever-growing project list neat and organized with sub-projects.</p>

<p>You can collapse sub-projects under their “parent” projects to temporarily hide them from view. This helps to focus on the right projects at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.</p>

<p>Adding a task, project or section is a quick process but sometimes this process stops or does not respond mainly to problems with the internet connection. Planner 2.6 creates the tasks asynchronously with the possibility of being able to cancel the process at any time.</p>
