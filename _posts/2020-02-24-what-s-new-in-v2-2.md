excerpt: Hi everyone! Planner 2.3 is here –  a big update for the Quick Find feature, recurring tasks and design improvements.
---

A new update comes to Planner. Planner is a task manager with good design and synchronization with Todoist.

### Quick Add

Don't worry about which app you're using. You can use a keyboard shortcut to open the **Quick Add** window, where you can enter a pending task and quickly return to work.

- The default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl + Tab` but you can change it from preferences.

### Label improvement

The label system was improved. Now you can drag and drop to sort and search by name

### Share your Projects

Now you can share your Projects in Markdown format or send it by email.

### A few more things…

- The design has been improved and many new animations have been added.
- Improved the synchronization system with Todoist.
- Now you can add a project directly in a work area.
- Customize your window controls to your liking.
- Visual enhancements for tasks that have already expired.

Planner 2.2 is available for download now on [AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.alainm23.planner/) and [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.alainm23.planner). We hope you’ll enjoy these improvements.
