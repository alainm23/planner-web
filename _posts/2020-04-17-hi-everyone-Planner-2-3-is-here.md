Here's a big update for the Quick Find feature, recurring tasks, and design improvements. Are you ready for Planner 2.3?

### Quick Find
Quick Find arrives with a big redesign and a ton of new features to make integration with Planner better. First, the design is based on [Synapse Indicator](https://github.com/tom95/indicator-synapse) thanks to [Tom Beckmann](https://github.com/tom95), this new design allows us to better order the elements to be displayed.
Now you can do searches for **Tasks**, **Projects**, **Views** and **Labels**.
* Searches are more accurate and are highlighted if there are matches.
* You can navigate faster between Inbox, Today and Upcoming views.
* Search by labels and filter all your tasks.

### Recurring Tasks
Recurring tasks finally arrive at Planner 2.3, with support for Todoist and an easy way to use it,
but if you do not know that it is a recurring task we explain:

You likely have tasks that repeat themselves on a regular basis – monthly reports, putting out the garbage, remembering to call Mom on her birthday.
Instead of creating a new task for each occurrence, give it a recurring due date. When you complete a recurring task, it will automatically reset for the next due date with no extra effort required on your part.

- Repeat your tasks **every day**, **week**, **month** or **year**.
- When you complete a recurring task a **Quick Notification** will be sent showing you the new scheduled date.
- Recurring tasks sync with **Todoist**.

### A few more things…
We’ve also snuck in a few other small-but-great improvements that we know some of you will really appreciate:

- The design of the **Progress Indicator** for each project was improved.
- The **Areas** are now called **Folders** and the icon has been changed.
- Now you can order your **Folders**
- See your completed tasks in context.
- Now you can add a **Note** for each **Section**.
- View **URL** from the notes or the title of a task.
- It's now possible to create and assign a **Label** directly if it is not available.
- **Quick Action** to undo when a task is completed.
- The **Move to project** menu now displays the correct color for each project.
- **Quick Notifications** were designed.
- Planner animations are now more consistent.
- Performance was improved.
