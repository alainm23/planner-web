excerpt: Planner 2.4 for everyone – Priorities, Calendar events, Quick Add and more.
---
Over the the past few months we’ve been working on Planner 2.4, a big update with great new features. Priorities, calendar events, Quick Add for all platforms and more.

## <i class='far fa-flag'></i> Priority support
Not all tasks are created equal. Use priority levels to make sure the most important things on your list stand out.

You can give your tasks one of four priority levels – 1 being the most important (marked as red) and 4 being everything else (no color).

- To add a task priority even faster, you can type **p1**, **p2**, or **p3** right into the task field. Planner will automatically recognize and assign the right priority level when you create the task.
- Filter all your tasks with priorities from **Quick Find**.
- The priorities are synchronized with **Todoist**.

## <i class='fas fa-hourglass-start'></i> Project Deadline
When you have been given a date by which you need to complete a project or face consequences, add **Deadline**.
Here’s how to add a Deadline to your projects:

<ol>
<li>Select <b>Edit</b> by right-clicking on your project in the left pane.</li>
<li>Enable <b>Deadline</b> and select a date.</li>
<li>A progress indicator and the selected date are added in the project view.</li>
</ol>

## <i class='fa fa-link'></i> Links Everywhere
The app now handles links consistently in all places: inside the title, inside notes, and inside checklist items.

## <i class='fa fa-search'></i> Quick Find Improvements
You want to filter your tasks by priorities or by labels more quickly, **Open Quick Find** and select a filter, the labels and priorities are default every time you start Quick Find. The design and performance were also improved by making the searches faster.

## <i class='fas fa-plus-circle'></i> Quick Add Improvements
**Quick Add** came to Plane a long time ago but unfortunately it only works on elementary OS. Thanks to [Nils Asmussen](https://github.com/nils-asmussen) and [Bilal Elmoussaoui](https://github.com/bilelmoussaoui) it works in Flatpak.

* <i style='color: #f9c440;' class='fas fa-exclamation-triangle'></i> To make this possible we had to make some changes in flatpak and it's possible that the synchronization with Todoist doesn't work, to solve this you can re-login to your Todoist account from the preferences.
* To add a task priority, you can type **p1**, **p2**, or **p3** right into the task field.
* To add a date, you can type **today** or **tomorrow** right into the task field.

## <i class='fas fa-keyboard'></i> Keyboard Shortcuts Improvements
Keyboard shortcuts are now better in Planner. A new dialog has been added to see the full list of keyboard shortcuts and many keyboard shortcuts have been added and modified.

- Use <span class="keyboardkey">f1</span>  to open keyboard shortcuts dialog.
- Use <span class="keyboardkey">a</span> and <span class="keyboardkey">q</span> to create a new task.
- Use <span class="keyboardkey">p</span>, <span class="keyboardkey">f</span> and <span class="keyboardkey">s</span> to create a new project, folder or section.
- Use <span class="keyboardkey">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyboardkey">v</span> to create a task from the clipboard.

## <i class='far fa-star'></i> Today & Upcoming Improvements
Now you can sort your tasks by drag and drop and the option to reschedule your overdue tasks was added.

In **Upcoming** view is possible to add tasks directly using Magic Button and move your tasks to other dates by drag and drop.

## <i class='far fa-calendar-alt'></i> Calendar events
Calendar events is one of the most amazing features Planner has. Unfortunately not everyone could use this feature. Thanks to [Corentin Noël](https://github.com/tintou) Planner now supports the latest version of [EDS](https://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/stable/tech-eds.html) and calendar events are displayed correctly. 

## A few more things…

- Performance and memory usage have been improved.
- A checklist counter has been added for each task.
- The upcoming view has been redesigned making it more compact.
- The UX to order a section has been improved.
- UX has been improved by expanding or collapsing a section or folder.
- Option to duplicate a task has been added.
